📌 Objective
The purpose of Truman in the Virtual is to create an immersive 3D experience where users can explore a skybox environment directly in their browser. The project serves as an early prototype that demonstrates how virtual environments can be built with modern web technologies while maintaining accessibility and interactivity.

⚡ Problem Statement
Traditional web pages are two-dimensional and static, limiting user engagement and interaction. For applications in education, virtual tours, simulation, and entertainment, there is a need for lightweight, browser-based 3D environments that do not require specialized hardware or complex installations.

---------------------------------------------

💡 Proposed Solution
SkyScape Voyager provides an interactive 3D space by placing the user’s point of view inside a cube (skybox) surrounded by panoramic textures. Users can navigate freely inside this environment using mouse controls.

This prototype demonstrates:
- A browser-based immersive experience
- Integration of React for component-based structure
- Three.js for rendering 3D environments
- TailwindCSS for styling
- OrbitControls for smooth navigation

---------------------------------------------

🛠️ Technologies Used
- React – for building reusable UI components
- Three.js – for rendering 3D graphics inside the browser
- OrbitControls (Three.js extension) – for user navigation controls
- TailwindCSS – for responsive and clean UI styling
- Babel – to enable JSX directly in the browser during prototyping

---------------------------------------------

🔎 Current Status
This is a prototype version of the project. It currently focuses on rendering a skybox with navigable 3D controls. Future iterations will:
- Improve performance and optimization
- Integrate backend systems and databases
- Expand the environment with additional interactive elements
- Move towards a full-scale web application

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the project folder.
2. Place your skybox images (posx.jpg, negx.jpg, posy.jpg, negy.jpg, posz.jpg, negz.jpg) inside the project root.
3. Open index.html in your browser.
